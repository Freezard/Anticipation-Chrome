Anticipation for YouTube FAQ
=============

* **Q: Why are the times of the related videos hidden but not the time and progress bar of the video playing?**
* A: YouTube's HTML5 player probably isn't activated in your browser. Go to [youtube.com/html5](https://www.youtube.com/html5) to activate it.
* **Q: I clicked on the button to activate Anticipation while watching a YouTube video but nothing happened. What's wrong?**
* A: You need to refresh the page after activating Anticipation for it to take effect on the video you are currently watching.
* **Q: I clicked on the button to disable Anticipation and clicked on a YouTube video but the video time and progress bar were still hidden. What's wrong?**
* A: When you click on a video link when already inside YouTube, YouTube often doesn't refresh the entire page, only replacing the elements that it thinks it needs to. To solve this problem, just click your browser's refresh button.
* **What's the best way to contact the developer for other questions or to suggest new features?**
